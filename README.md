# Confined Calories
By Harrison Owens and Delaynie Gorgan
# A system that counts your calories and keeps the data as secure as possible. Who wants other people to know what they're eating?

Confined Calories is the most secure fitness application for counting calories and helping you manage your goals.

The user can enter their food throughout the day and keep track of their calories.
The application opens when the user enters a passcode. Nothing is saved in the Cloud. 
Everything is stored where the user knows it is and can find it.
Today, private information is not as private as most people would like to believe. 
That can be very frightening when everyone is trying to work on themselves but aren't ready to share their journey with others.
Confined Calories makes sure that you share your goals on your terms.
